# This file is a template for antora.yml.
# During a release, Maven substitutes the properties and stores result into target/antora-template.yml.
# That file is then copied to src/modules/antora.yml and committed to Git on the release branch.
# The timefold.ai website can then be refreshed from the release branch and/or tag.
